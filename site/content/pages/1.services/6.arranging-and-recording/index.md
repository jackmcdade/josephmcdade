  You have a song. The lyrics and melody are good. You have the basic chord progression and maybe even
  a guitar or piano part. You want to make it a full band arrangement, but are having trouble.
  That’s where I come in. In fact, this is what I love. I can arrange your music for a full band in
  nearly any style. Maybe you want to arrange the song for a full orchestra? I can do that too.

Let's say you have a song and the lyrics and melody are good. You have the basic chord progression and maybe even a guitar or piano part. You want to make it a full band arrangement, but are stuck making the jump to the next level.

This is where I come in. **This is what I love.** I can arrange your music for a full band in nearly any style. Maybe you want to arrange the song for a full orchestra? I can do that too. 

Or maybe you have a song that’s _nearly perfect_, but you need a guitar part to give it that last push. Send me what you’ve got, tell me what you’re looking for, and I can add that extra sizzle right here from my own studio.
