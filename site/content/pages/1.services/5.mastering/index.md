summary: "Mastering has been (quite-fairly) labeled as a “dark art”. It’s the last stop for tweaking the sound of you music at a top level – balancing the sound and loudness of songs across an entire album and carefully raising the volume and loudness to industry standard levels. It's finicky and requires a very subtle and trained ear."

I _love_ mastering. Let me put the final polish on your hard work. All I need is the final stereo bounces from your sessions and a few reference tracks.
