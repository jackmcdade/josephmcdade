Most people don't love staring at waveforms all day with a scissor tool. But I do.

Working on a podcast or audiobook? I can get rid of all those pesky pops, mess ups, and unnecessary breaths and leave you with a well-organized, clean, and concise product. Maybe the drummer in your recording session was having a bad day or you just canâ€™t decide which vocal take was the best. I can help. 

I know so many Pro Tools shortcuts. So very, very many.
