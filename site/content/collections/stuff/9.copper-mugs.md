My wife and I love cocktails. So much so that nearly every week we have "Cocktail Sunday" with our neighbors who, like us, love themselves some gin and mezcal.

These are great Moscow Mule mugs. They're hip this year. It would seem that every trendy kitchen has a set. These are great. Good weight, 100% copper, and a comfortable handle. I love them, but you gotta clean them regularly or else they tarnish. Such is the world of copper.
