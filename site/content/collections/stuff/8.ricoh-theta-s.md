This thing is sweet. I had planned to do something with this and add a service to my local web presence, outsourcing the 360/virtual tours, but...it was just too tedious of a business model. It's cool for sure, works great, but alas it is in a drawer. It serves no real purpose to me.

If you want to buy mine I'll knock off 25% off whatever the going price is and send it your way. I also have that [super skinny tripod](http://amzn.to/2zRqltC) they recommend using with it. No complaints with it.
