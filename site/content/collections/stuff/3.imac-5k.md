Unlike the iPhone 8, the AirPods are a flippin' **grand slam**. Apple really through of everything here - stereo is mixed into mono if you use just one of them so you don't miss anything. They charge while in the carrying case. You can even configure a double-tap on each ear to play/pause, summon Siri, or play the prev/next track. Oh and the sound quality is great.

I still think they missed out on a huge opportunity calling them AirBuds though. What a shame.
