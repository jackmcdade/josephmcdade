I was lead by the descriptions and reviews that this would team up with our existing Kitchen Echo and essentially extend its range. We put this one by our TV so the kids could use it for their video game timers without shouting across the house (they get 1 hr/day). I had also planned to wire it into our surround sound system and extend the whole-house music situation.

It did not deliver on its promises. Once wired into the receiver, the Dot's internal speakers were turned off even for basic interactions, which means it can't function as a timer. As for synced audio? I knew it didn't have Spotify support, but even the basic Amazon Music integration was out of sync by the second song. Unfortunately for our use case, this Dot is a paperweight.
