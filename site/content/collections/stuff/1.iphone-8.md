I bought it and shipped it back in the same day. It felt all wrong. First off, it was too heavy. 10 grams may not sound like much, but it was enough to be afraid I would let it slip out of my hands. The glass body also made it instantly clammy or slippery. It was uncomfortable to hold and altogether too unfamiliar.

I'm perfectly happy with my iPhone 7 (although a bit frustrated with iOS 11). It'll do just fine.
